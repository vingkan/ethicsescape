# Introduction

Welcome to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). You work for a team called the Moral Defense Oversight Service (MDOS) that provides ethical guidance to DHS. We have invited you to take part in a serious, classified case that concerns the safety of your fellow Americans. In particular, we have been notified of a possible terrorist attack that if credible will occur within the next 24 hours. We are asking for your guidance to help shape how we conduct our investigation in an ethical yet timely manner. In particular, we want you to design an authorization form regarding intelligence procurement from suspects.

The room you are in is secure and full of documents that may be of interest. Unfortunately, we were informed too late of the scenario to organize briefing materials or decode documents. All briefing materials are present in the room but need to be found and all codes are in the form of a number. When you have decided on a form, please submit it in the box below.

Please be mindful of the time you take for this very important decision. We only have 24 hours to gather intelligence and act on the threat at hand, meaning we need a final authorization form in less than one hour. We will check up on you throughout this hour for updates.
