I thought this might be useful to you:

> The Principle of Intervening Action
> We are responsible for our actions, even if someone else caused us to act that way. We are not responsible for the consequences of actions taken by others because of us.

It is often misused, so you could check out some of what I hear get tossed around at the office. Decide which statements are supported by the principle of intervening action and those numbers should line up to form the password of a pamphlet I sent to the APA.

> 87. DHS conducted surveillance of direct messages between users on Twitter and discovered a plan to attack a school bus. DHS advised the school bus to modify its route and apprehended the attackers at the anticipated site. The attackers were brought into custody because of the surveillance by DHS.

> 43. DHS did not use enhanced interrogation on a suspect and later learned that the suspect had information that could have prevented two deaths. DHS could have prevented those deaths.

> 91. DHS ignored the release request of a suspect because the suspect would not share information about an assassination threat. The next day, the suspect was fired from their job because DHS did not release them.
