# Excerpt from an Americans for Fairness Pamphlet

America has strayed from the values of fairness. The moral position of the Americans for Fairness is that any transgression by government that wrongfully tips the scales of society merits an action in response. The actions of our group are justified by:

- Unfair practices affecting our communities
- Actions by our nationâ€™s leaders to create divides within society
- Inaction by others, which amounts to compliance with an unfair regime

We make our values concrete through the declaration that:

- Leaders who leverage disproportionate force to squash the concerns of the average Americans are tyrants; such aggressors are not capable of governance
- American society suffers from a lack of respect and loyalty to parents; a child is the only source of moral force that can protect its parents from a tyrannical force
- Cowards hide behind bureaucracy and lack the courage to act out of their own intentions; do not trust pacts made with such stooges
