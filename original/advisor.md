# Advisor Assessment

**By Dr. Carl Rush, DHS**

We should view this threat as credible. In our surveillance of AFF, we have seen a sharp increase in violent actions against innocent civilians. Some members identified as leaders of AFF previously worked as military contractors, now retired, so I do not doubt that they are capable of executing an attack like the one described by Anthony Haven. What I do doubt is that such people would use the word “bomb” in jest.

This kind of attack is rare in the public eye, but not unprecedented. The availability of materials for construction of explosive devices has enabled bad actors across the country with little to no formal training to attack municipal sites for political purposes.

We cannot divulge the specific details of these incidents because you do not have sufficient clearance to view these classified materials. However, in other cases, authorities have been able to extract information from the perpetrators through the use of enhanced interrogation techniques that are much less harsh than any used by the military. In similar cases, we consider the information obtained to be life-saving.

If even one civilian is killed as a result of this attack, it would represent the gravest consequence imaginable. However, any harm caused to civilians is unacceptable because they are all innocent bystanders.
