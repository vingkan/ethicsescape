# Situation Briefing

This morning, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials apprehended Anthony Haven, a 27-year-old male, for interrogation about a bomb threat in the area. Haven claimed responsibility for placing a bomb in an unnamed grocery store on social media, indicating that it would detonate in exactly 24 hours. Bomb squads have searched all relevant sites but have not discovered a threat.

Havenâ€™s social media profile shows links to Americans for Fairness (AFF), a political activism group that has increasingly adopted violent tactics. Two weeks ago, local authorities arrested four members of AFF for breaking into a local Armenian restaurant overnight and destroying the kitchen. On social media, other known members of AFF have expressed desire for stronger action, including a call to bomb a local farmers market.

Haven maintains that he has planted a bomb in a local grocery store and, at the time of writing, it is scheduled to detonate in four hours. Haven refuses to divulge the location or any other information related to the attack. DHS officials have determined that legal grounds exist to permit enhanced interrogation of Haven if he does not cooperate.

DHS requests the advice of the Moral Defense Oversight Service (MDOS) on how to proceed. Please find two proposed interrogation authorization forms attached and offer your guidance as to which of the two should be used. Your recommendation is due in one hour.
