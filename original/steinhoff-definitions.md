# Steinhoff Definitions

## Necessity
The action must be necessary to prevent a greater harm. There must be no alternative means available that would be equally effective.

## Imminence
The threat must be imminent - it must be about to occur or is in the process of occurring. The danger must be immediate, not distant or hypothetical.

## Mildest Means
The action taken must be the mildest means available to achieve the goal. If a less harmful alternative exists, it must be used instead.

## Proportionality
The harm caused by the action must be proportional to the harm it prevents. The action should not cause more harm than it prevents.
